abstract = {{This position paper presents a vision of a future in which business schools and scholars worldwide have successfully transformed their research toward responsible science,2 producing
useful and credible knowledge that addresses problems important to business and society.3 This
vision is based on the belief that business can be a means for a better world if it is informed by
responsible research. The paper begins with a set of principles to support responsible research
and proposes actions by different stakeholders to help realize this vision. It explains the impetus
for the proposal by describing the current business research ecosystem, which encourages
research oriented toward scholarly impact much more than societal relevance. Changing the
incentives and culture around publications are essential to promoting responsible research.
Research is the foundation of business education and practice, yet business research has failed to
live up to its promise in promoting better policies and best practices. If nothing is done, business
research will lose its legitimacy at best; at worst, it will waste money, talent, and opportunity.
This paper ends with a call to action for directing research toward achieving humanity’s highest
aspirations. The paper invites discussion and debate on the prospect of creating a responsible
research ecosystem to realize this future vision when business and management research has
become a force for change toward a better world.}},

              a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver
              the best of expectations over many application sectors across the
              field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire
              community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an
              inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by
              sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were
              not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and
              rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within
              the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely
              acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of
              AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the
              existing literature and contributions already done in the field
              of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached.
              For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define
              explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel
              definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior
              conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for
              which the explainability is sought. Departing from this
              definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent
              contributions related to the explainability of different Machine
              Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep
              Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built
              and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves
              as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by
              XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and
              explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of
              Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for
              the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real
              organizations with fairness, model explainability and
              accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide
              newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can
              serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research
              advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from
              other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity

                   simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In
                   particular, applied economists are often interested in
                   estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like
                   teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for
                   many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In
                   these settings, machine learning methods that combine
                   regularized estimation and data-driven choices of
                   regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting.
                   In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of
                   machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and
                   pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of
                   many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to
                   applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized
                   estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of
                   regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize
                   the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and
                   derive their relative performance as a function of simple
                   features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we
                   show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters,
                   based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on
                   cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close
                   to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice
                   of regularization parameters. We use data from recent

              questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working
              on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic
              modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in
              fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex
              data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to
              data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to
              use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from
              exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set

               illustrate econometric issues that arise in decision problems.
               Subjective expected utility (SEU) can provide normative guidance
               to an investor making a portfolio choice. The investor, however,
               may have doubts on the specification of the distribution and may
               seek a decision theory that is less sensitive to the
               specification. I consider three such theories: maxmin expected
               utility, variational preferences (including multiplier and
               divergence preferences and the associated constraint
               preferences), and smooth ambiguity preferences. I use a simple
               two-period model to illustrate their application. Normative
               empirical work on portfolio choice is mainly in the SEU

  abstract = "The paper considers the role of econometrics in decision making
              under uncertainty. This leads to a focus on predictive
              distributions. The decision maker's subjective distribution is
              only partly specified; it belongs to a set S of distributions. S
              can also be regarded as a set of plausible data-generating
              processes. Criteria are needed to evaluate procedures for
              constructing predictive distributions. We use risk robustness and
              minimax regret risk relative to S. To obtain procedures for
              constructing predictive distributions, we use Bayes procedures
              based on parametric models with approximate prior distributions.
              The priors are nested, with a first stage that incorporates
              qualitative information such as exchangeability, and a second
              stage that is quite diffuse. Special points in the parameter
              space, such as boundary points, can be accommodated with
              second-stage priors that have one or more mass points but are
              otherwise quite diffuse. An application of these ideas is
              presented, motivated by an individual's consumption decision. The
              problem is to construct a distribution for that individual's
              future earnings, based on his earnings history and on a

               computation and information technology. With it have come vast
               amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine,
               biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding
               these data has led to the development of new tools in the field
               of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,
               machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have
               common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
               terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these
               areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is
               statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than
               mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of
               color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and
               anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The
               book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
               to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural
               networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
               boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in
               any book. This major new edition features many topics not
               covered in the original, including graphical models, random
               forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path
               algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and
               spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for
               ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and
               false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and
               Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford
               University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie
               and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a
               popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the
               statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and
               invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the

               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this

               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal

  abstract = "Virtualization technology is the underlying element of cloud
              computing. Traditionally, cloud computing has employed virtual
              machines to distribute available resources and provide isolated
              environments among users. Multiple virtual machines, with their
              own operating system and services, can be deployed and run
              simultaneously on the same physical machine on the cloud
              infrastructure. Recently, a more lightweight virtualization
              technology is being rapidly adopted and it is based on
              containers. A key difference between virtual machines and
              containers, is that containers share the same underlying
              operating system. In this work, we studied the combination of
              these two virtualization technologies by running containers on
              top of virtual machines. This synergy aims to enhance containers'
              main drawback, which is isolation and, among others, to simplify
              the system management and upgrade, and to introduce the new
              functionalities of containerized applications to virtual
              machines. The benefits of this method have been recognized by big
              cloud companies, which have been employing this approach for
              years. With this paper, we aimed to present the advantages of
              running containers on virtual machines and to explore how various
              virtualization techniques and configurations affect the
              performance of this method. Although, in bibliography there are a
              few papers that used this method partially to conduct
              experiments, there is not any research which considers this
              method from our integral aspect of view. In this study, we ran
              Docker containers and evaluated their performances, not only on
              KVM and XEN virtual machines, but also we ran Linux containers on
              Windows Server. We adopted an empirical approach, to quantify the
              performance overhead introduced by the additional virtualization
              layer of virtual machines, by executing various benchmarks and
              deploying real world applications as use cases. Furthermore, we
              presented for first time, how isolation is applied on virtual
              machines and containers, we evaluated different operating systems
              optimized to host containers, mechanisms of storing persistent
              data and, last but not least, we experimentally quantified the

               lives. Today ML algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently
               only expert humans could perform. As it relates to finance, this
               is the most exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology that
               will transform how everyone invests for generations. Readers
               will learn how to structure Big data in a way that is amenable
               to ML algorithms; how to conduct research with ML algorithms on
               that data; how to use supercomputing methods; how to backtest
               your discoveries while avoiding false positives. The book
               addresses real-life problems faced by practitioners on a daily
               basis, and explains scientifically sound solutions using math,
               supported by code and examples. Readers become active users who
               can test the proposed solutions in their particular setting.
               Written by a recognized expert and portfolio manager, this book
               will equip investment professionals with the groundbreaking
               tools needed to succeed in modern finance.",

               presents a unified treatment of machine learning and various
               statistical and computational disciplines in quantitative
               finance, such as financial econometrics and discrete time
               stochastic control, with an emphasis on how theory and
               hypothesis tests inform the choice of algorithm for financial
               data modeling and decision making. With the trend towards
               increasing computational resources and larger datasets, machine
               learning has grown into an important skillset for the finance
               industry. This book is written for advanced graduate students
               and academics in financial econometrics, mathematical finance
               and applied statistics, in addition to quants and data
               scientists in the field of quantitative finance. Machine
               Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice is divided into
               three parts, each part covering theory and applications. The
               first presents supervised learning for cross-sectional data from
               both a Bayesian and frequentist perspective. The more advanced
               material places a firm emphasis on neural networks, including
               deep learning, as well as Gaussian processes, with examples in
               investment management and derivative modeling. The second part
               presents supervised learning for time series data, arguably the
               most common data type used in finance with examples in trading,
               stochastic volatility and fixed income modeling. Finally, the
               third part presents reinforcement learning and its applications
               in trading, investment and wealth management. Python code
               examples are provided to support the readers' understanding of
               the methodologies and applications. The book also includes more
               than 80 mathematical and programming exercises, with worked
               solutions available to instructors. As a bridge to research in
               this emergent field, the final chapter presents the frontiers of
               machine learning in finance from a researcher's perspective,
               highlighting how many well-known concepts in statistical physics
               are likely to emerge as important methodologies for machine

                   model-agnostic methods within explainable artificial
                   intelligence. These values are designed to attribute the
                   difference between a model's prediction and an average
                   baseline to the different features used as input to the
                   model. Being based on solid game-theoretic principles,
                   Shapley values uniquely satisfy several desirable
                   properties, which is why they are increasingly used to
                   explain the predictions of possibly complex and highly
                   non-linear machine learning models. Shapley values are well
                   calibrated to a user's intuition when features are
                   independent, but may lead to undesirable, counterintuitive
                   explanations when the independence assumption is violated.
                   In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing
                   Shapley values that generalizes recent work that aims to
                   circumvent the independence assumption. By employing Pearl's
                   do-calculus, we show how these 'causal' Shapley values can
                   be derived for general causal graphs without sacrificing any
                   of their desirable properties. Moreover, causal Shapley
                   values enable us to separate the contribution of direct and
                   indirect effects. We provide a practical implementation for
                   computing causal Shapley values based on causal chain graphs
                   when only partial information is available and illustrate
                   their utility on a real-world example.",

               by citing the uniqueness result from

               method that satisfies certain good properties
               (\textbackslashemphaxioms). There are, however, a multiplicity
               of ways in which the Shapley value is operationalized for model
               explanation. These differ in how they reference the model, the
               training data, and the explanation context. Hence they differ in
               output, rendering the uniqueness result inapplicable.
               Furthermore, the techniques that rely on they training data
               produce non-intuitive attributions, for instance unused features

  author    = "Merton, Robert C",
  abstract  = "[The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900
               when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option
               pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow
               a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous
               researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper
               begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing
               formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less.
               These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be
               consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to
               the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying
               common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be
               changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly
               by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the
               firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to
               uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional
               assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal
               Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for
               pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and
               the new ``down-and-out'' option are derived. The effects of
               dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined.
               The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the
               pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.]",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMany scientific and engineering challenges?ranging from
               personalized medicine to customized marketing
               recommendations?require an understanding of treatment effect
               heterogeneity. In this article, we develop a nonparametric
               causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects
               that extends Breiman?s widely used random forest algorithm. In
               the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show
               that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true
               treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and
               centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical
               method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the
               true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest
               estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian
               theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our
               knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type
               of random forest, including classification and regression
               forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In
               experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more
               powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor
               matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.",

  abstract  = "This study proposes a novel technique by extending balanced
               scorecards with risk management considerations (i.e., risk
               metrics and insolvency risk) for corporate operating performance
               assessment and then establishes a fusion mechanism that
               incorporates hybrid filter-wrapper subset selection (HFW),
               random vector functional-link network (RVFLN), and ant colony
               optimization (ACO) for operating performance forecasting. The
               study executes HFW, which preserves the advantages of wrapper
               approaches, but prevents paying its tremendous computational
               cost, in order to determine the essential features for
               forecasting model construction. With the merits of rapid
               learning speed and no extra inherent parameters needed to be
               tuned, RVFLN helps establish the forecasting model. However,
               RVFLN has demonstrated that its superior forecasting performance
               comes with the challenge of being unable to represent the
               inherent decision logic for humans to comprehend. To cope with
               this task, the study conducts ACO so as to extract the inherent
               knowledge from RVFLN and represents it in human-readable format.
               If the extracted knowledge is not comprehensive for decision
               makers, then they will not be able to interpret and verify it.
               In this circumstance, the decision makers probably will not
               trust enough the extracted knowledge and be prone to making
               unreliable judgments more easily. The introduced mechanism
               herein is examined by real cases and poses superior forecasting
               quality under numerous examinations. It is a promising
               alternative for corporate operating performance forecasting.",

Our single-factor model      reproduces the failure of the CAPM in explaining the value premium in      finite samples without disasters and its relative success in samples with      disasters. Due to beta measurement errors, the estimated beta-return      relation is flat, consistent with the beta “anomaly,” even though the true      beta-return relation is strongly positive. Finally, the consumption CAPM      fails in simulations, even though a nonlinear model with the true pricing      kernel holds exactly by construction.}},

abstract = {{Given the competition for top journal space, there is an incentive to      produce “significant” results. With the combination of unreported tests,      lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirect p-hacking,      many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In      addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical      significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be      sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, even t > 3 will produce a      large number of false positives. Here I explore the meaning and      limitations of a p-value. I offer a simple alternative (the minimum Bayes      factor). I present guidelines for a robust, transparent research culture      in financial economics. Finally, I offer some thoughts on the importance      of risk taking (from the perspective of authors and editors) to advance      our field.

  abstract  = "Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
               examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and
               subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is
               about using regression to solve real problems of comparison,
               estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other
               books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and
               missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps
               right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately.
               Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience
               demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with
               practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing
               methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a
               smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis
               is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with
               code available online. Graphics and presentation aid
               understanding of the models and model fitting.",
